PJSUA Ada bindings
=============

Provides an interface for including a SIP user agent in an Ada progam.

Installation
----
For now, there is only the thin bindings which is pseudo-generated with gcc and a basic test case.
To build it, you need PJSIP+PJSUA. Fear not, the Makefile should take care of it for you.

Just run:
 make deps

To build the pj(sip|sua) libs

And then
 make to build the test case

TODO

* gcc: error trying to exec 'gnat1': execvp: No such file or directory

It seems that there are some hiccups with locating gnat1. For what it's worth, it can be
worked around by simply specifying the location of gnat1. E.g:
 
 PATH=$PATH:/usr/gnat/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.5.4/ make
